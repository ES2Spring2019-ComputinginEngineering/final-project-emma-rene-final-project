# Maritime Disaster Survival Rate Analysis

Our project analyzes the crew and passenger lists from three different historical maritime disasters (The SS Norge, Golden Gate, and Titanic sinking), graphs the data on 3D plots, and tells you whether or not an individual will survive given a specific age, sex, and class.

## Instructions

- Run the main.py file to start the program. 
- When prompted, answer the questions regarding sex, age, and social class. 
- The file will take this information and ultimately return a predicted fate based on statistics from each of the maritime distasters we used.
